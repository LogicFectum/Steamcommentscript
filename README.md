1. Open your steam account in your browser
2. Open your friend list
3. Right click > Inspect Element > console
4. Copy all the code from "steam comment.txt" file
5. Paste inside console
6. You will get a box to write something.
Avoid using words like "Buy, Trade, Sell" this will give you community ban.

Features:

If you want to post comments one time click on button one time. If you want 3 times click on 3 times post button. 

----------------------------

Note:

The script takes seconds to post another comment that doesn't gives you ban. It only works inside friendlist people.

This script doesn't gives you ban as I have been using it since years, but still use it at your own risk. 


Good luck!
